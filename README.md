# BittaApp Prototype (HCI)
A simple Android app prototype. No real functionality other than UI/UX design prototype demo.

Built using **Jetpack Compose and Material 3**

This project was built for the `Human Computer Interaction` exam.

## Project Structure

- The final project relation, the most important document!
- `BittaApp/` folder contains the final app source code as an Android Studio project
- Other folders have the [Work Material](#work-material), excluding sensitive data like audio and video recordings.

Each folder may contain a .gitignore file listing all omitted files.

## Work material

All project material includes:
