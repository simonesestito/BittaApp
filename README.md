# BittaApp Prototype (HCI)
A simple Android app prototype. No real functionality other than UI/UX design prototype demo.

Built using **Jetpack Compose and Material 3**

This project was built for the `Human Computer Interaction` exam.

All project material includes:
- research
- camera studies
- interviews
- user forms
- storyboards
- prototypes (on Figma and on paper)
- competitor analysis
- final report

It's all available in Italian language and it'll be uploaded to this repo soon.
Anyway, things like video and audio recordings won't ever be published here for privacy reasons.
